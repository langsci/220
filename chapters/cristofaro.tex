\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
In the functional-typological approach that originated from the work
of Joseph Greenberg, language universals (henceforth, typological
universals) are skewed cross-linguistic distributional patterns whereby languages recurrently display certain grammatical configurations as opposed to others. Explanations for these patterns are usually result-oriented, in the sense  that at least some of the relevant configurations are assumed to arise because of some postulated principle of grammatical structure, which favors those particular configurations and disfavors other logically possible ones.

For example, a number of word order correlations\is{word-order correlation} have been explained by assuming that speakers will recurrently select particular word orders as opposed to others because these orders lead to syntactic structures that are easier to process\is{processing} (\citealt{Hawkins2004},  among others). Another case in point is provided by explanations of the use of explicit marking for different grammatical meanings, for example the use of overt marking for different \isi{number} values, or that of dedicated \isi{case} marking for different NP types occurring in particular argument roles. Cross-linguistically, explicit marking may be restricted to less frequent\is{frequency} meanings, for example \isi{plural} rather than \isi{singular}, animate\is{animacy} rather than
inanimate\is{animacy} P arguments, or inanimate\is{animacy} rather than animate\is{animacy} A arguments, but
is usually not restricted to more frequent\is{frequency} meanings.\footnote{Following a standard
    practice in typology (see, for example, \citealt{Comrie2} or \citealt{Dixon1994}), the labels A, P and S are used throughout
    the paper to refer to the two arguments of \isi{transitive} verbs and
    the only argument of \isi{intransitive} verbs.} This has been assumed to reflect a principle of \isi{economy} whereby speakers will tend to use explicit marking only when they really need to do so. Explicit marking can be restricted to less frequent\is{frequency} meanings because more frequent ones are easier to identify, and hence less in need to be disambiguated\is{ambiguity}
\citep{Greenberg1966,Corbett2000,TU2,Martinmarkedness,Haspelmath2008}. 

These explanations are based on the synchronic properties of the
relevant distributional patterns, not the actual diachronic processes
that shape these distributions from one language to another. For
example, assumptions about the role of \isi{processing} ease in determining particular word order correlations\is{word-order correlation} are based on the synchronic syntactic configurations produced by particular \isi{word order}s, not the actual diachronic origins of these orders from one language to another. Similarly, the idea that the use of explicit marking reflects \isi{economy} is based on the synchronic cross-linguistic distribution of particular
constructions across different contexts (e.g. zero vs. overt marking
across \isi{singular} and \isi{plural}, dedicated \isi{case} marking across animate\is{animacy} and
inanimate\is{animacy} A and P arguments), not the actual diachronic processes that give rise to this distribution in individual languages. 

This paper discusses various types of diachronic evidence about the
cross-linguistic origins of two phenomena that have been described in
terms of typological universals, the distribution of \isi{accusative} vs.
\isi{ergative} \isi{case} marking \isi{alignment} across different NP types and that of
zero vs. overt marking across \isi{singular} and \isi{plural}. 

This evidence, it will be argued, challenges classical, result-oriented explanations of typological universals in two major ways.  First, recurrent grammatical configurations cross-linguistically do not appear to arise because of principles that favor those particular configurations in themselves. This challenges the idea that these principles play a
role in the emergence of the distributional patterns described by the
relevant universals.  
Second, individual configurations arise through several distinct
  diachronic processes, which do not obviously reflect some
  general principle. This challenges the idea that explanations for
  particular distributional patterns can be read off from the
  synchronic properties of the relevant grammatical configurations,
  because these properties can originate differently in different
  cases. 
These facts call for a source-oriented approach to typological universals, one in which the patterns described by individual universals are accounted for in terms of the actual diachronic processes that give rise to the pattern, rather than the synchronic properties of the  pattern in itself.

\section{The animacy/\isi{referential hierarchy}: Some possible origins of
  {alignment} splits in {case} marking}
  \label{alignment}

One of the most famous typological universals is the \isi{animacy}/\isi{referential hierarchy} in \refP{hierarchy}:


\exNG{hierarchy}{1st \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s  $>$ 2nd \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s $>$ 3rd \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s
 $>$ human $>$ animate\is{animacy}
  $>$ inanimate\is{animacy}  (\fatcitNP{TU2}{130}, among others)}

\noindent Among other phenomena, this hierarchy\is{referential hierarchy} captures some recurrent splits\is{split ergativity}
in the distribution of
\isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} \isi{case} marking \isi{alignment}
 across different NP types.
 Accusative \isi{alignment}
  can be restricted to a left end portion of the hierarchy (e.g.  \isi{pronoun}s, human and animate\is{animacy}
nouns), but is usually not restricted to a right end portion of the hierarchy (e.g. inanimate\is{animacy} nouns, nouns as opposed to
\isi{pronoun}s). Conversely, \isi{ergative} \isi{alignment}  is sometimes restricted to a right end portion of the hierarchy\is{referential hierarchy} (e.g. inanimate\is{animacy}
nouns, nouns as opposed to \isi{pronoun}s, nouns and 3rd \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s), but is usually not restricted to a left end portion of the hierarchy
(1st/2nd \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s, \isi{pronoun}s as opposed to nouns, \isi{pronoun}s and animate\is{animacy} nouns).

A classical result-oriented explanation  for this distribution invokes the \isi{economy}
principle mentioned in Section \ref{intro}. Speakers  tend to use dedicated \isi{case} marking  only when
it is really needed, that is, when some grammatical role is more in
need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity}. The NPs towards the right end of the
hierarchy\is{referential hierarchy} (inanimates\is{animacy}, nouns as opposed to \isi{pronoun}s) are more likely to occur as P arguments, hence, when they do, the P role is relatively easy to identify, and hence less in need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity}. Dedicated \isi{case} marking for P arguments, leading to \isi{accusative} \isi{alignment}, may then be limited to the NPs towards the left end of the hierarchy (\isi{pronoun}s, animate\is{animacy} nouns). By contrast, these NPs are more likely to occur as A arguments, hence, when they do, the A role is less in need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity}. Dedicated \isi{case} marking for A arguments, leading to
\isi{ergative} \isi{alignment}, may then be limited to the NPs towards the right end of the hierarchy\is{referential hierarchy}
 (\citealt{Silverstein1976,Dixon1979_Erg,Dixon1994_Erg,Comrie1981_Typ,DeLancey1981,Song2001,TU2}). 

This explanation, however, is not  supported by the available
diachronic evidence about the origins of the relevant grammatical configurations across languages. In many cases where \isi{accusative} or \isi{ergative} \isi{alignment} is restricted to
particular NP types, the relevant \isi{alignment} pattern is a result of the development of an \isi{accusative} or \isi{ergative} marker through the reinterpretation\is{reanalysis} of a pre-existing element with similar distributional restrictions.  In some cases, for example, \isi{accusative} markers restricted
to pronominal\is{pronoun}, animate\is{animacy} or  definite\is{definiteness} direct \isi{object}s are structurally identical to \isi{topic} markers. This is illustrated  in \refP{kanuri} for \ili{Kanuri}.

\noindent In such cases, the \isi{accusative} marker plausibly originates from the \isi{topic} marker in contexts where the latter refers to a P argument and is reinterpreted\is{reanalysis} as a marker for this argument (`As for X' $>$ `X ACC': see, for example, \citealt{Rohlfs1984} and \citealt{Pensado1995} for \ili{Romance} languages, and \citealt{Konig2008} for several African languages). Topics\is{topic} are usually pronominal\is{pronoun}, animate\is{animacy} and definite\is{definiteness}, so \isi{topic} markers are mainly used in the same contexts as the resulting \isi{accusative} markers. 

Ergative\is{ergative} 
\label{p:cristofaro:ergatives}
markers not applying to first and second \isi{person}
\isi{pronoun}s have been shown to originate
from various types of source elements not applying to these \isi{pronoun}s
either. Sometimes, for example,  the \isi{ergative} marker is derived from an indexical
element, such as a \isi{demonstrative} or a third \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}, as
illustrated in \refP{bagandji} for \ili{Bagandji}.
\citet{McGregor2006,McGregor2008} argues that in such cases the indexical
element is
originally used to emphasize the referent of the A argument, as this
referent is a new or unexpected \isi{agent}. This strategy does not
    apply to  first and second \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s because the referents
    of these pronouns are typically expected agents.

In other cases, the \isi{ergative} marker is derived from a marker used to encode instruments\is{instrumental} in \isi{transitive} sentences with no overt third \isi{person} arguments. In these sentences, the
  instrument can be reinterpreted\is{reanalysis} as an \isi{agent}, thus evolving into the A
  argument of the sentence. As a result,  the
 marker originally used for the instrument\is{instrumental} becomes an \isi{ergative} marker. This process has
  been reconstructed\is{reconstruction} by \citet{Mithun2005} for \ili{Hanis Coos}, illustrated in
  \refP{hanis}.  Instruments are typically inanimate\is{animacy}, so the relevant markers 
do not usually occur with first and second \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s.

\z

Restrictions in the distribution of particular
\isi{alignment} patterns across different NP types can also be a result of
phonological processes targeting a subset of these
NPs. 
In \ili{English}, for example, \isi{accusative} \isi{alignment}
  became restricted to \isi{pronoun}s as a result of nouns losing the
  relevant inflectional distinctions due to \isi{sound change}, as illustrated in Table
  \ref{blake}.

\end{table}

In \ili{Louisiana Creole}, A, S and P arguments were originally
undifferentiated for both nouns and \isi{pronoun}s. Pronominal\is{pronoun} A and S forms, however, underwent phonological reduction\is{phonetic reduction}, plausibly due to their high discourse \isi{frequency}. As a result, as can be seen from Table \ref{apics}, \isi{pronoun}s developed
 distinct forms for A and S
    arguments on the one hand and P arguments on the other, while nominal A, S, and P arguments
    remained undifferentiated. This led to an \isi{accusative} \isi{case} marking
    \isi{alignment} pattern restricted to \isi{pronoun}s \citep{HaspelmathAPiCS}.

\end{tabular}
  
  \caption{Pronominal declension in Louisiana Creole \citep{HaspelmathAPiCS}}\label{apics}
  \end{table}

These various processes do not appear to be triggered by the fact
that, in the resulting grammatical configurations, dedicated \isi{case} marking is
restricted to roles more in need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity}. 
In some cases, a
pre-existing element is reinterpreted\is{reanalysis} as a
marker for a co-occurring argument. Topic\is{topic} markers
are reinterpreted\is{reanalysis} as markers for a co-occurring P argument, and
\isi{demonstrative}s and third \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s are reinterpreted\is{reanalysis} as markers
for a co-occurring A argument.  This is a metonymization\is{metonymy} process triggered by the
  contextual co-occurrence of the relevant elements. In other cases,
  a pre-existing element evolves into a \isi{case} marker as a
  result of the \isi{reanalysis} of the argument structure of the
  construction. Such processes are plausibly due to meaning
  similarities between the source construction and the resulting
  construction, for example, instruments\is{instrumental} can be reinterpreted\is{reanalysis}
as \isi{agent}s because of their role in the action being described,
  particularly in the absence of an overtly expressed
  \isi{agent}. 
 In yet other cases, an existing \isi{alignment} pattern becomes restricted to
particular NP types because other NPs, due to their phonological
properties, lose their inflectional distinctions as a result of
regular \isi{sound change}. Finally, particular NPs may develop distinct forms
for some argument roles as a result of the original forms undergoing
phonological reduction\is{phonetic reduction} due to their discourse \isi{frequency}. 

Restrictions in the distribution of \isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} aligment,
as determined by individual processes, directly follow from  restrictions in the distribution of
various source constructions, or in the domain of application of particular developmental mechanisms (such as particular phonological processes). These restrictions too, then, cannot actually
be taken as evidence  for principles that favor the resulting
grammatical configurations independently of particular source
constructions and developmental mechanisms. This is further
supported by the fact that, when the source constructions or the
developmental mechanisms involved are not subject to particular
distributional restrictions, the distribution of \isi{accusative} or
\isi{ergative} \isi{alignment} does not display those restrictions either.

For example, \isi{accusative}
markers sometimes originate from `take' verbs in constructions of the type `Take
X and Verb (X)', where the `take' verb is reanalyzed\is{reanalysis} as a marker
for its former
       P argument (\citealt{Lord1993,Chappell2013}, among
         several others). The P arguments of `take' verbs can be pronominal\is{pronoun}, nominal, animate\is{animacy} or inanimate\is{animacy} (e.g. `take him, it, the child, the sword'), 
and the resulting \isi{accusative} markers apply to all of these
argument types. This is illustrated for \ili{Twi} 
%and 
%Mandarin
  %       \ili{Chinese} 
in 
 \refP{twi},
%and \refP{mandarin}, 
where the \isi{accusative} marker {\em de},
         derived from a `take' verb, applies to both animate\is{animacy} and inanimate\is{animacy} P arguments.

Accusative\is{accusative} and \isi{ergative} markers  can  also develop from the
  \isi{reanalysis} of \isi{possessor} or \isi{oblique} markers used on the notional A or
  P arguments of various types of source constructions, for example,
  `X is occupied with the Verbing  {\bf of} Y $>$ `X
        is Verbing Y {\bf ACC}', `{\bf To} X it will be the Verbing
        of Y' $>$ `X {\bf ERG} 
        will Verb Y',  `Y is X{\bf 's} Verbed thing', `Y is
        Verbed {\bf by} X'
        $>$ `X {\bf ERG} Verbed Y'. These processes have been described for
        a wide variety of languages (see, for example,
     \citealt{HarrisCampbell1995,Bubenik1998,Gildea1998,Creissels2008}). In such cases
        too,  the relevant A and P arguments can be nominal,
        pronominal\is{pronoun}, animate\is{animacy} or inanimate\is{animacy} NPs (e.g. `The Verbing of
        you, of it, of the house'; `You are Verbed, the house is
        Verbed'). The  markers used for these arguments, then,  will
        be used with all of these NPs, and the resulting \isi{accusative} or
        \isi{ergative} markers are used with all of these NPs too. This is
        illustrated in \refP{wayana} and \refP{carina}, where \isi{accusative} and
        \isi{ergative} markers derived in this way are used, respectively,
        with nominal inanimate\is{animacy} and pronominal\is{pronoun} animate\is{animacy} arguments.

On a similar note, loss of inflectional distinctions through \isi{sound
change},
leading to the loss of particular \isi{alignment} patterns, targets specific
forms because of their phonological properties. This process, then, can affect different NP types cross-linguistically,
provided that the relevant forms have specific phonological
properties. This leads to different distributional
restrictions for particular \isi{alignment} patterns. In \ili{English}, as
detailed earlier, the process affected nouns as
opposed to \isi{pronoun}s, leading to \isi{accusative} \isi{alignment} becoming
restricted to \isi{pronoun}s. In  \ili{Nganasan}, however, a combination of \isi{sound change} and
analogical levelling\is{analogy} led to a loss of inflectional
distinctions for \isi{pronoun}s, but not for nouns
\fatcit{Filimonova2005}{94--98}. As a result, as can be seen from
\refP{nganasan}, \isi{accusative} \isi{alignment} became
restricted to nouns, even though this configuration should be
disfavored in terms of \isi{economy}, because nominal P arguments are less in need
of disambiguation\is{ambiguity} than pronominal\is{pronoun} ones.

If there were principles that favor or disfavor particular distributional
restrictions for \isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} aligment because of properties of the
resulting grammatical configurations, we would not expect the development of
these restrictions to be tied to specific source
constructions and developmental mechanisms. 

Finally, individual distributional restrictions develop through several distinct
processes, which are rather different in nature and provide
independent motivations for the restriction. In some cases, particular
restrictions arise as \isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} \isi{case} markers develop
through processes of context-driven reinterpretation\is{reanalysis} of various types
of source elements, which, for different reasons, are restricted in the same way. In other cases, the restrictions reflect the domain of
application of different phonological processes. To the extent that different diachronic processes provide different
motivations for particular distributional restrictions, 
explanations for these restrictions cannot be read off from the
restrictions in themselves, because these can originate differently in
different cases.

\section{Some possible origins of zero vs. overt marking for singular
  and plural}\label{number}
Another well-known typological
universal pertains to the use of zero vs. overt
marking for \isi{singular} and \isi{plural}. Languages can use overt marking for \isi{plural} and \isi{zero marking} for
  \isi{singular}, but usually not the other way round. A classical,
  result-oriented explanation for this pattern, as
  mentioned in Section \ref{intro},  is in terms of \isi{economy}. Speakers tend to use overt marking
  only for meanings that are more in need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity}, and \isi{plural} is more in need of disambiguation\is{ambiguity} than \isi{singular} due to its
  lower discourse \isi{frequency}. As a result, overt marking can be limited
  to \isi{plural}, whereas it will not be limited to \isi{singular} (\citealt{Greenberg1966,TU2};
  \citealt{Haspelmath2008}).  This explanation, however, is not
supported by a number of diachronic processes that lead languages to
have zero marked\is{zero marking} singulars and overtly marked plurals.


Often, in languages which make no distinction between \isi{singular}
and \isi{plural}, an overt \isi{plural} marker evolves through the reinterpretation\is{reanalysis} of
pre-existing expressions, whereas
    \isi{singular}s retain \isi{zero marking}. Sometimes, some expression takes on a \isi{plural} meaning originally associated with
      a co-occurring expression. For example, in \isi{partitive}
      constructions involving \isi{plural} quantifiers (`many
      {\bf of} them' $>$ `they  {\bf \textsc{pl}}'), the \isi{partitive} marker can take on the meaning of
      \isi{plural}ity associated with the \isi{quantifier} as the latter is
      lost. This process took place in  \ili{Bengali}, as illustrated in \refP{bengali}.

In other cases, \isi{plural}ity becomes the central meaning of expressions
inherently or contextually
associated with this notion but originally used to encode other meanings, for example, \isi{distributive} expressions
(`house here and there') or expressions of multitude (`all', `people'). This is illustrated in \refP{paiute} and \refP{maithili}.

Another process that leads languages to have \isi{zero marking} for \isi{singular}
and overt marking for \isi{plural} is the elimination of an overt \isi{singular}
marker through regular \isi{sound change} in a situation where both \isi{singular}
and \isi{plural} are originally overtly marked. This was, for example, the case in
\ili{English}, where \isi{singular} and \isi{plural} were both originally overtly
  marked in most cases. The current
configuration with zero marked\is{zero marking} singulars and {\em -s} marked plurals
resulted from a series of \isi{sound change}s that led to the
elimination of all inflectional endings except \isi{genitive} \isi{singular} {\em
  -s} and \isi{plural} {\em -es} (\citealt{Mosse}). 


These various processes do not appear to be triggered by the higher need to
disambiguate\is{ambiguity} \isi{plural} as opposed to \isi{singular}. In some cases, an overt
\isi{plural} marker arises as a result of a metonymization\is{metonymy}
process whereby \isi{plural} meaning is transfered from a \isi{quantifier} to some
other component of a complex expression. This is plausibly due to the
co-occurrence of the two. In other cases, some
expressions evolves into a \isi{plural} marker because it is contextually or
inherently associated with the notion of \isi{plural}ity, and this notion becomes the
central meaning of the expression as some other meaning component is
bleached\is{bleaching}. In yet
other cases, a pre-existing overt \isi{singular} marker is eliminated due to
regular \isi{sound change}s driven by the phonological properties of the
marker. 

The end result of the various processes, the use of  overt marking for
\isi{plural} rather than \isi{singular}, is directly motivated in
terms of the properties of particular source constructions and
developmental mechanisms.  In many cases,  an overt
marker is  used for \isi{plural} because the source construction is one associated with the notion of
plurality. Alternatively, sound changes leading to the elimination of
an overt marker target \isi{singular} rather than \isi{plural} markers due to the
phonological properties of the former. The fact that overt marking
is restricted to \isi{plural}, then, cannot be taken as evidence for
principles that favor this particular configuration independently of
particular source constructions and developmental mechanisms. As in
the case of \isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} \isi{case} marking \isi{alignment}, this point
is further supported by the fact that other source
constructions and developmental mechanisms give rise to different
configurations, that is, overt marking for both \isi{singular} and \isi{plural},
or just for \isi{singular}.

A case in point is provided by Kxoe\il{Khwe},
illustrated in Table \ref{kxoe} below. This language has \isi{gender}
markers derived from third \isi{person} \isi{pronoun}s \citep{Heine1982}. As the
pronouns have overt \isi{singular} and \isi{plural} forms, the resulting \isi{gender}
markers also encode \isi{singular} and \isi{plural}, so that the language has
overt marking not only for \isi{plural}, but also for \isi{singular}.

Also, as described above, \isi{partitive} \isi{case} markers can evolve into \isi{plural} markers by
taking on the \isi{plural} meaning associated with a co-occurring \isi{plural}
\isi{quantifier}. In expressions where the \isi{quantifier} is \isi{singular} (`one of

\isi{singular} markers, sometimes leading to a configuration where only \isi{singular}
is overtly marked. This was the case in \ili{Imonda}, which has zero marked\is{zero marking} \isi{plural}s, but developed
an overt non-\isi{plural}
(\isi{singular} and \isi{dual}) marker
 from a source\is{ablative} \isi{case} marker used in \isi{partitive} constructions \fatcit{Imonda}{38--39}.

Similar observations apply to loss of \isi{number} markers through \isi{sound
change}. This process can affect
either \isi{singular} or \isi{plural} markers depending on the phonological
properties of the marker. From one language to another, then, the process may lead either to zero marked\is{zero marking} singulars and
overtly marked plurals, as detailed above for
\ili{English}, or to the opposite configuration. In the
\ili{Indo-Aryan} language \ili{Sinhala},  for example, some inanimate\is{animacy} nouns have
overtly marked singulars and
zero marked\is{zero marking} \isi{plural}s
 (e.g. {\em pot-\textbf{\textit {a}}/pot} `book-\textsc{sg}/book.\textsc{pl}'). This was a result of
 \isi{sound change}s leading to the loss of the \isi{plural} ending of a specific inflectional class in the ancestor language
% specific inflectional class in middle indica (declension ii, which is the ancestor of today's inanimate classes, e.g. at-a SG at PL 'hand, 256)
 \citep[250--256]{NitzNordhoff2010}. Similarly, in \ili{Nchanti}, a Beboid
 language, nouns in classes 3/4 have overt
  marking in the \isi{singular} and \isi{zero marking} in the \isi{plural}, e.g. {\em
    k{\bf ʷ}\=əŋ}/{\em
    k\=əŋ} `firewood.\textsc{sg}/firewood.\textsc{pl}, {\em k{\bf
      ʷ}ēē/kēē} `moon.\textsc{sg}/moon.\textsc{pl}'.
  Originally, both \isi{singular} and \isi{plural} were marked overtly through the
  two prefixes {\em *u-} and {\em *i-} respectively. As these were
  eliminated, the \isi{singular} prefix led to the \isi{labialization} of the
  initial consonant of the stem, while the \isi{plural} prefix left no trace
  \citep{Hombert1980}.

Finally, just like distributional restrictions for \isi{accusative} and
\isi{ergative} \isi{case} marking \isi{alignment}, the fact that a language uses \isi{zero marking} for \isi{singular}
and overt marking for \isi{plural} can be a result of a variety of
diachronic processes,
 which lead to this particular configuration for different
reasons.  
In many cases, both \isi{singular} and \isi{plural} are originally zero marked\is{zero marking} (i.e., the language makes no distinction between the two), but
\isi{zero marking} becomes restricted to \isi{singular} because different expressions, for different reasons, evolve into \isi{plural}
markers.  In other cases, both
\isi{singular} and \isi{plural} are originally overtly marked, and \isi{sound change}
leads to the loss of \isi{singular} markers due to their phonological
properties. Explanations for why overt marking is restricted to \isi{plural}, then,  cannot be read off from this configuration in itself,
because it can originate differently in different cases.


\section{Rare grammatical configurations and result-oriented explanations}\label{martin}

Result-oriented explanations of typological universals are crucially
 based on
the fact that certain logically possible grammatical configurations
are significantly rarer than
others in the world's languages. This is usually accounted for by
postulating  principles that both disfavor those configurations
and favor some of the other configurations. For
example, the rarity of configurations where \isi{singular} is
overtly marked and \isi{plural} is zero marked\is{zero marking} is assumed to be due to the
fact that these configurations are disfavored by \isi{economy}, and hence
will usually not occur in  the world's languages. This same
principle is assumed to also favor the opposite configuration, \isi{zero marking} for
\isi{singular} and overt marking for \isi{plural}, thus providing a motivation for
the occurrence of this configuration.

\citetv{chapters/haspelmath} uses this line of reasoning to claim that
result-oriented explanations should be invoked even in cases where
the development of some grammatical configuration is accounted
for by the properties of particular source constructions or developmental
mechanisms, rather than synchronic properties of the configuration in itself. Haspelmath concedes that, in such cases, there is no direct evidence that the occurrence of the
configuration is motivated by principles pertaining to its synchronic
properties (functional-adaptive\is{adaptation} principles, in his terminology). He argues, however, that this
hypothesis is supported by two types of indirect evidence: the fact
that other logically possible configurations are significantly rarer, and what he calls
multi-\isi{convergence}, the fact that different diachronic processes all
lead to that particular configuration. According to Haspelmath, these facts
can only be accounted for by assuming that the occurrence of
the configuration is ultimately motivated by
principles that favor that configuration independently of the
diachronic processes that give rise to it.
 Haspelmath draws a parallel with the notion
of adaptiveness\is{adaptation} in \isi{evolution}ary biology (and other domains):
The development of particular traits is independent of the fact that
those traits are adaptive\is{adaptation} to the \isi{environment}, in the sense of conferring an \isi{evolution}ary advantage to the organisms
carrying them, but adaptiveness\is{adaptation} provides the ultimate explanation for their
spread and survival in a population.

There is, however, a logical fallacy in the idea that, if some
 principle motivates the  non-occurrence of some
configuration (and hence its rarity),
then the occurrence of some other configuration is motivated by the
same principle. The fact that some principle A provides the motivation
for some phenomenon X can be framed as a logical implication\is{implicational universal},  X
$\rightarrow$ A (because X will always involve A, unless other
motivations for X are also postulated).  This
implication means, however, that the absence of A will lead to phenomena different
than X, that is, $\sim$A $\rightarrow$ $\sim$X, not that phenomena
different from X are also motivated by A. This would be a distinct logical
implication, $\sim$X $\rightarrow$ A, with a different truth table.
For example, if the non-occurrence
of configurations where \isi{singular} is
overtly marked and \isi{plural} is zero marked\is{zero marking} (X) is assumed to be due to
\isi{economy} (A), this means that principles other than \isi{economy} ($\sim$A) will lead to the occurrence of other configurations ($\sim$X), not that
the latter phenomenon is also due to \isi{economy}. This undermines the general logic of result-oriented explanations, including Haspelmath's
argument: From the fact that some principle provides 
a motivation for the non-occurrence of some
configuration, we cannot conclude that it also provides a
motivation for the occurrence of other configurations.

As for the multi-\isi{convergence} argument, this
ignores the fact that different
diachronic processes can all lead to the same synchronic output for
different reasons, as detailed in Sections \ref{alignment} and
\ref{number}. If the same synchronic output is motivated
differently in different cases, multi-\isi{convergence} cannot be taken as
evidence for principles that favor that output
independently of the individual processes that give rise to
it. Instead, to the extent that the various processes recurrently take place in
different languages, the cross-linguistic distribution of the output
will be a combined result of the effects of each process. 

From a logical point of view, source-oriented explanations do not rule
out that the cross-linguistic distribution of particular grammatical
configurations may ultimately also be determined by properties
pertaining to the synchronic properties of the configuration, as
assumed by Haspelmath. For example, these factors could play a role in
the \isi{transmission} of the configuration from one speaker to another, or
its retention across different generations of speakers. This would be
the equivalent of the notion of adaptive\is{adaptation} \isi{evolution} through natural
\isi{selection} in \isi{evolution}ary
biology: particular genetic traits do not develop because they
they confer an \isi{evolution}ary advantage to the organisms
carrying them, but this provides the ultimate explanation for their
distribution in a population.\footnote{A referee suggests that this is
  similar to \citegen{Lass1990} use of the notion of
  \isi{exaptation}: particular grammatical traits may lose their original
  function, but they are retained in the language because they are
  deployed for novel functions.  This, however, is meant to account for why
  particular traits  survive in a language despite losing their
  original function, not why they are
  selected over others, as is the case with result-oriented
  explanations of typological universals and explanations of
  biological \isi{evolution} in terms of adaptiveness\is{adaptation} through natural \isi{selection}.}
  
\newpage
In \isi{evolution}ary biology, however, there is direct evidence for
adaptiveness\is{adaptation}, in that particular genetic traits make it  demonstrably more likely for the organisms
carrying them to survive and pass them on to their
descendants. For languages, on the other hand, there is generally no evidence that the
fact that some grammatical configuration conforms to the principles
postulated in result-oriented explanations, for example \isi{economy}, makes 
it more likely for that configuration to spread and survive in a
speech community. In fact, there is a long tradition of
linguistic thought in which the \isi{propagation} of individual
constructions within  a speech community is entirely determined by
social factors independent of particular inherent properties of the
construction (see, for example, \citealt{McMahon1994}
and \citealt{BillLC} for reviews of the relevant issues and
literature). 

In principle, there is another sense in which particular
grammatical configurations could be adaptive\is{adaptation}. While individual
configurations directly reflect the properties of particular
source constructions or developmental mechanisms, it could be the case
that the specific diachronic processes that give rise to the configuration are ultimately
favored by principles pertaining to its synchronic properties. For example, different
processes of context-driven reinterpretation\is{reanalysis} leading to overt marking for less frequent\is{frequency}
types of argument roles could be favored by the need to
give overt expression to these roles. Similarly, different processes leading to \isi{zero marking} for singulars (\isi{zero marking}
becoming restricted to \isi{singular} due to the development of an overt \isi{plural}
marker, phonological erosion\is{phonetic reduction} of an existing overt \isi{singular}
marker) could be favored by the lower need to give overt
expression to \isi{singular} as opposed to \isi{plural}.

These assumptions, however, 
are not part of any standard account of the relevant processes in
studies of language change (see \citealt{BybeeEtAl1994}: 298--300 and  \fatcitNP{Slobin2002}{381} for an explicit rejection of this view in
regard to \isi{grammaticalization}, as well as \citealt{Otadependencies} for
more discussion).
In fact, diachrony provides specific evidence against the
idea that particular grammatical configurations develop both
because of properties of particular source constructions or developmental
mechanisms and because of
principles that favor the configuration in itself. As detailed in Sections
\ref{alignment} and \ref{number}, different source constructions and developmental mechanisms
give rise to different grammatical configurations, even when this goes
against some postulated principle that favors some of these
configurations as opposed to the others.
This is not what one would expect if there
were principles favoring particular grammatical
configurations independently of the specific source constructions or
developmental mechanisms that give rise to them.

\newpage
All this means that, to the extent that a principled source-oriented
explanation is available for the occurrence of particular grammatical
configurations, explanations in terms of the synchronic properties of
the configuration are redundant, because we do not have either direct
or indirect evidence for these explanations (see \citealt{Blevins2004} for
similar arguments in phonology, and \citealt{Newmeyer2002,Newmeyer2004} for an application of
this line of reasoning to optimality-theoretic\is{Optimality Theory} models of typological
universals). Of course, one still needs to account for the fact that
certain logically possible grammatical configurations
are significantly rarer than others. This phenomenon, however, is logically
independent of the possible motivations for the occurrence of the more
frequent configurations, as
detailed above. To the extent that
individual grammatical configurations arise due to properties of
particular source constructions or developmental mechanisms, any differences in the frequency of particular
configurations will reflect differences in the frequency of
the source constructions or developmental mechanisms that give
rise to those configurations. The higher
frequency of particular configurations will then  be a result of the higher frequency of the  source
constructions and developmental mechanisms that give rise to them,
while the rarity of other configurations
will be due to the rarity of possible
source constructions or developmental mechanisms for those
configurations (see \citealt{Harris2008} for an earlier formulation of this point
in regard to tripartite \isi{case} marking \isi{alignment}). Frequency differences in the occurrence of particular source
constructions or developmental mechanisms need to be
accounted for, but they need not be related to any properties of the
resulting configurations, so they should be investigated independently.

\section{Concluding remarks}
Source-oriented explanations of typological universals are  in line with classical
views of language change held within
\isi{grammaticalization} studies and historical linguistics in
general. These views are manifested, for example, in accounts of the
development of \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} systems, or \isi{alignment}
patterns (\citealt{BybeeEtAl1994,HarrisCampbell1995,Gildea1998,TraugottDasher2002}, among others). In these accounts, grammatical change
is usually not related to synchronic properties of the resulting
constructions, for example the fact that the use of these
constructions complies with some postulated principle of optimization
of grammatical structure. Rather, grammatical change is usually a result of the properties of particular
source constructions and the contexts in which they are used. In
particular, new grammatical constructions recurrently emerge through
processes of context-induced reinterpretation\is{reanalysis} of pre-existing
ones, and their distribution originally reflects the distribution of the
source constructions. 

In 
\label{p:cristofaro:strands}
source-oriented explanations,  the patterns
captured by typological universals originate from several distinct diachronic processes, which involve
different source constructions and developmental mechanisms. 
These
processes recurrently take place in different languages, and are
plausibly motivated by the same factors from one language to another. Individual patterns, however, are a combined
result of the cross-linguistic frequencies of the various processes, rather than a result
of some 
overarching principle independent of these processes.

While
this scenario is 
more complex and less homogeneous than those assumed in result-oriented explanations, it is consistent with what is known about the actual origins of
the relevant grammatical configurations in individual languages, and it
makes it possible to address several facts  not accounted for in
these explanations. 

For example, the patterns captured by typological universals usually
have \isi{exception}s. This is
in contrast with the assumption that these patterns reflect principles of optimization of
grammatical structure that are valid for all languages, because in
this case one has to account for why these principles are violated in
some languages. Also, individual principles invoked in result-oriented
explanations are often in contrast with some of the
grammatical configurations captured by individual universals. For
example, the idea that \isi{zero marking} of more frequent\is{frequency} meanings is
motivated by \isi{economy} is in contrast with the fact that these meanings
are overtly marked in many languages. 

These facts have sometimes been
dealt with in terms of \isi{competing motivations} models, but a general
problem with this approach is that it may lead to a
proliferation of explanatory principles for which no independent
evidence is available (\fatcitNP{Newmeyer1998}{145--153}, \citealt{Otacompetingmotivations}, among
others). If the patterns captured by typological universals reflect the properties of different
source constructions and developmental mechanisms, however, then 
\label{p:cristofaro:commonalitiesexceptions}
it is
natural that they should have \isi{exception}s, because not all
languages will have the same source constructions, nor will
particular developmental mechanisms be activated in all
languages. Principles pertaining to the synchronic properties of the
pattern will fail to account for all of the relevant grammatical
configurations because the pattern is not actually motivated by those principles.

Over the past decades, several linguists have emphasized the need for
source-oriented explanations of typological universals (\citealt{Bybee1988_Diachr,Bybee2006_Univ,Bybee2008_StructPres,Aristar1991_Diachr,Gildea1998_Carib,Otareferential,Otacompetingmotivations,Otadependencies,Anderson2016_Change}). This
view, however, has not really made its way into the actual typological
practice, despite the close integration between typology and studies
of language change (a fully fledged research approach along these lines is, on
the other hand, the \isi{Evolutionary Phonology} framework developed in
\citealt{Blevins2004}). While diachronic evidence about the origins
of the patterns captured by individual universals is much scantier and
less systematic than the synchronic evidence about these patterns, 
 it poses specific foundational problems for existing result-oriented explanations of these universals. These problems point to a
new research agenda for typology, one  focusing on what source constructions and developmental
mechanisms play a role in the shaping of individual cross-linguistic
patterns, as well as why certain source
constructions or developmental mechanisms are rarer than others.
